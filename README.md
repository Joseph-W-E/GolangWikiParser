# GolangWikiParser

Welcome to my introduction to Golang. This project's goal is to demonstrate how a **pipeline** can be realized in Golang using some its provided features.

## The Pipeline

So what is a pipeline? As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)) blissfully puts it:

> A pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements (processes, threads, coroutines, functions, etc.), arranged so that the output of each element is the input of the next.

In short, it basically means that whatever data is put into the pipeline is processed and spit out at the end.

## The Tools

What does Golang provide to make this pipeline happend?

### Channels

Brief explanation about channels and why they're helpful.

### Goroutines

Brief explanation about goroutines and why they're helpful.

### Fan Out

Brief explanation about the idea of fan-out and why it makes processing faster.

### Fan In

Brief explanation about fan-in and why it helps the pipeline.

### Range

Brief explanation about how range is used to read from channels.
